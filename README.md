# Bloom Filter Implementation in Go

I have implemented a Bloom filter data structure in Go. A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set.

## Features

- Thread-safe operations
- Customizable size and number of hash functions
- Estimated false positive rate calculation
- Union operation for combining filters


## Running the Demo

To run the demonstration program:

```bash
go run cmd/main.go
```

## Running Tests

To run the unit tests:

```bash
go test ./...
```
